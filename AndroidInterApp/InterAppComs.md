# Intents and intent filters

## 	Invoking components through intents

**Intents** are used to invoke *activities*, *services* and *send broadcasts* to another app. 

![Intent types](image-20191221225317413.png)

### Explicit

```java
Intent downloadIntent = new Intent(this, DownloadService.class);
downloadIntent.setData(Uri.parse(fileUrl));
startService(downloadIntent);
```

> **Note:** An explicit intent is always delivered to its target, regardless of any intent filters the component declares.

> Using an intent filter isn't a secure way to prevent other apps from starting your components. Although intent filters restrict a component to respond to only certain kinds of implicit intents, another app can potentially start your app component by using an explicit intent if the developer determines your component names. If it's important that *only your own app* is able to start one of your components, do not declare intent filters in your manifest. Instead, set the [`exported`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#exported) attribute to `"false"` for that component.

### Implicit

An implicit intent specifies an action that can invoke any app on the device able to perform the action. 

```java
// Create the text message with a string
Intent sendIntent = new Intent();
sendIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, textMessage);
sendIntent.setType("text/plain");

// Verify that the intent will resolve to an activity
if (sendIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {
    startActivity(sendIntent);
}
```

### Data

### Actions

### Category

## Defining intent-filters

Each app can define **intent-filters** for its *activities*, *services*, *broadcast receivers*.

### Manifest

By default any activity that does not have the attribute `exported="false"` explicitly could be invoked **implicitly** if it defines any action filter.

`android.intent.action.*`

`android.intent.extra`

### Programmatically

```JAVA

```

# Broadcasts

https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts

## Sending a broadcast

`sendBroadcast`

`sendOrderedBroadcast`

`LocalBroadcastManager.sendBroadcast`

## Local broadcast

-  You know that the data you are broadcasting won't leave your app, so don't need to worry about leaking private data. 
-  It is not possible for other applications to send these broadcasts to your app, so you don't need to worry about having security holes they can exploit. 
-  It is more efficient than sending a global broadcast through the system. 

## Listening for broadcasts

# Services

![Caution 3](image-20191221225501979.png)

**Note**: To avoid inadvertently running a different app's `Service`, always use an explicit intent to start your own service.

# Content Provider

## Permissions

A provider's application can specify permissions that other applications must have in order to    access the provider's data. These permissions ensure that the user knows what data    an application will try to access. Based on the provider's requirements, other applications    request the permissions they need in order to access the provider. End users see the requested    permissions when they install the application.

â€‹    If a provider's application doesn't specify any permissions, then other applications have no    access to the provider's data. However, components in the provider's application always have    full read and write access, regardless of the specified permissions.

------

**Note:** To access a provider, your application usually has to request specific    permissions in its manifest file. This development pattern is described in more detail in the  section [Content Provider Permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics#Permissions).

------

`extends ContentProvider `

`public static final Uri CONTENT_URI = Uri.parse("content://"`
